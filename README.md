# Kron
A fast and scalable high level language that provides frontend and backend capabilities simultaneously with an emphasis on code readability. It's supposed to combine the best of most programming languages:

- high performance / speed
- high memory efficiency
- high degree of user control (e.g. control of memory usage)
- simple and exact syntax (as far as allowed by above)
- wide range of core functionality (frontend and backend)

Kron uses the .kr file extension for everything.
